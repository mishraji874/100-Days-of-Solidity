/*

1. Use Block Number üìå
Instead of relying solely on timestamps, consider using the block number as a reference point for time-related decisions. Block numbers are immutable and are not subject to manipulation.

2. External Time Oracle ‚è≥
In cases where accurate timestamps are essential, you can integrate an external time oracle. These oracles fetch real-world time and provide it to your smart contract, minimizing the risk of manipulation.

3. Thresholds and Confirmations üìÜ
Implement thresholds and confirmation mechanisms for time-dependent actions. Require multiple blocks to confirm the passage of time before executing critical functions.

Vulnerability Overview
The vulnerability known as ‚ÄúBlock Timestamp Manipulation‚Äù involves the potential manipulation of the `block.timestamp` value by miners. This manipulation can occur under specific constraints, which include:

1. The manipulated timestamp cannot be set to an earlier time than the parent block‚Äôs timestamp.
2. The manipulated timestamp cannot be set too far into the future.

The exploitation of this vulnerability can have serious implications, especially in cases where smart contracts rely on the accuracy and immutability of timestamps to make critical decisions.
*/

//Vulnerable Smart Contract Example: Roulette Game

pragma solidity ^0.8.17;
contract Roulette {
 uint public pastBlockTime;
constructor() payable {}
function spin() external payable {
 require(msg.value == 10 ether);
 require(block.timestamp != pastBlockTime);
pastBlockTime = block.timestamp;
if (block.timestamp % 15 == 0) {
 (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
 require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
 }
 }
}

/*
Exploitation Scenario
1. The attacker, let‚Äôs call them Eve, deploys the Roulette contract and sends 10 Ether to it.
2. Eve mines a new block and manipulates the `block.timestamp` to a future time that is divisible by 15.
3. Eve‚Äôs manipulated block is successfully included in the blockchain.
4. Eve calls the `spin` function, and since the manipulated `block.timestamp` meets the winning condition, she wins the game and receives all the Ether.

Preventative Techniques
To mitigate the risks associated with block timestamp manipulation, consider the following preventative techniques:

1. Avoid Using `block.timestamp` for Critical Decisions: As demonstrated in the vulnerable contract, relying on `block.timestamp` for making important decisions, especially involving financial transactions, can expose your contract to vulnerabilities. Instead, use more secure sources of randomness and entropy.

2. Use External Randomness Sources: Integrate external randomness sources or oracles to generate random numbers for your smart contract. These sources can provide a layer of security against timestamp manipulation by miners.

3. Implement Thresholds and Confirmations: Design your contract in a way that requires multiple blocks and confirmations before executing time-sensitive operations. This reduces the impact of potential timestamp manipulation.

4. Avoid Economic Incentives Based on Timestamps: Refrain from creating economic incentives that are heavily dependent on specific timestamp conditions, as they can be exploited by attackers with control over the block timestamp.
