/*
An Ethereeum wallet is a software application that enables users to securely store, send and recieve ether.

But is doesn't store your ether. Insttead, it securely stores your private keys  which can be used to access your ether.

Types of Ethereum Wallets:

1. Web Wallets: These wallets operate through web browsers and are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. They are convenient but require users to trust the wallet provider with their private keys.

2. Desktop Wallets: Installed directly on your computer, desktop wallets offer enhanced security by allowing you to control your private keys. They provide an offline storage option, protecting your assets from online threats.

3. Mobile wallets: Designed for smartphones, mobile wallets provide a convenient way to manage Ether on the go. They offer a balance between accessibility and security, with options to back up and secure your private keys.

4. Hardware wallets: These physical devices are considered one of the most secure options for storing Ether. They store private keys offline, providing an extra layer of protection against potential hacking attempts.

5. Paper wallets: A paper wallet is a physical document that contains your private and public keys in a printed form. While they may seem archaic, they offer offline storage and can be highly secure if generated in a trusted environment.

6. Hybrid wallets: These wallets combine multiple wallet types to offer a broader range of features. For example, a hybrid wallet might integrate a hardware device with a mobile app for convenience and security.

/*
Explanation: In this code, we have a `private` variable called `owner`, which will store the address of the wallet owner. The `constructor` sets the `owner` as the account that deploys the smart contract. We also have a `modifier` named `onlyOwner` to restrict certain functions to be called only by the owner.
In the `deposit` function, users can send Ether to the wallet, increasing the wallet balance. The `getBalance` function allows anyone to check the current balance of the wallet. The `withdraw` function allows the owner to withdraw a specific amount of Ether from the wallet.

üîê Implementing Security Measures
To enhance the security of our Ether Wallet, we can implement additional measures. Here are a few ideas:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-factor authentication (MFA): Implement an MFA system using additional contracts or external libraries to require multiple factors for certain actions, adding an extra layer of security.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Event logging: Emit events for critical actions, such as deposits and withdrawals, to keep a record of all important transactions within the wallet.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Timelock mechanism: Implement a timelock feature to delay certain actions, allowing the owner to cancel them within a specific timeframe if necessary. This can prevent accidental or malicious actions.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Upgradeability: Consider implementing upgradeability patterns, such as the Proxy or Eternal Storage pattern, to ensure that your smart contract remains upgradable while maintaining its security features.
