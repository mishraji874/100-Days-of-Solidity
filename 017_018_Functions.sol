// Functions
/*
Two types:
1. View functions: These functions are used to retireve and return data from the function without modifying the state of the contract. These functions are used to provide read-only access to the contract's state variables.

2. Pure functions: These functions not only do not modify the state, but they also do not read or access any state variables. Pure functions are entirely self-contained and rely only on the input parameters provided to them.

Benefits of Using View and Pure Functions üí°
1Ô∏è‚É£ Security: By explicitly declaring functions as view or pure, you provide clarity to other developers and auditors regarding the intended behavior of the function. This helps prevent unintentional modifications to the state and minimizes the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Gas Efficiency: View and pure functions do not require transactions to be executed on the blockchain. As a result, they do not consume any gas, making them more cost-effective when retrieving data or performing computations.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Code Reusability: View and pure functions can be called by other functions within the same contract or by external contracts. This promotes code reusability and modular design, as these functions can be used in multiple contexts without concerns about state modifications.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Optimization: Since pure functions are entirely self-contained and do not rely on external variables, they can be optimized by the compiler more aggressively. This can lead to improved performance and reduced gas costs.
