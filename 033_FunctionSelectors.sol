// Function Selectors
// When it comes to executing functions in Solidity smart contracts, the first 4 bytes of the `calldata` hold immense power. These bytes, known as function selectors, act as unique identifiers for each function within a contract. They pave the way for efficient function execution, as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) leverages these selectors to locate and invoke the desired function accurately. Think of them as the secret keys that unlock the doors to specific functions within a contract.


//Optimizing Gas Costs
//Gas is the lifeblood of the Ethereum network, representing the computational effort required to perform operations. Within this vast ecosystem, every operation, including function calls, incurs gas costs. However, by precomputing and inlining function selectors, you can minimize these costs and enhance the efficiency of your smart contracts.

/*
Explanation: To represent function selectors, Solidity provides the `bytes4` type â€” a fixed-sized array of 4 bytes. The `keccak256` function plays a pivotal role in this process, as it computes the Keccak-256 hash of the given input. By passing the function signature, including the function name and its parameter types, to the `keccak256` function, we can generate the function selector.

In this contract, the `getSelector` function accepts a string `_func` as input and returns the corresponding function selector. By converting the string `_func` to bytes and applying the `keccak256` hash function, we obtain the hash representing the function selector. To ensure it matches the `bytes4` type, we cast the hash accordingly.

By deploying this contract on the Ethereum network, you can programmatically generate function selectors for various functions in your contracts. This approach provides a convenient and efficient way to obtain function selectors dynamically.
