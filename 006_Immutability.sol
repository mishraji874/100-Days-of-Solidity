// Immutability
// In solidity, immutable varibales are similar to constants in other programming languages. Once assigned a value, they cannot be modified or reassigned.
// This keyword enchances the security and trust in the execution of the dApp.

contract Immutable {
    address public immutable MY_ADDRESS;
    uint public immutable MY_UINT;

    constructor(uint _myUint) {
        MY_ADDRESS = msg.sender;
        MY_UINT = _myUint;
    }
}

// Here in the above code MY_ADDRESS and MY_UINT variables are immutable which means that these variables can't be modified or reassigned in the future.

/*
Benefits and Use Cases of Immutability:
1. Security and Trust: Immutability enhances security in smart contracts by ensuring that critical variables, such as contract addresses or configuration parameters, remain unchanged. This prevents potential vulnerabilities that could arise from malicious modifications.

2. Predictability: Immutable variables provide predictability in contract execution. Since their values remain constant, developers and users can rely on these variables to always have the same values throughout the contractâ€™s lifespan. This predictability is crucial for building robust and reliable decentralized applications.

3. Optimization: Solidity can optimize contracts that use immutable variables. The compiler can replace references to these variables with their actual values, eliminating the need for storage access during contract execution.
