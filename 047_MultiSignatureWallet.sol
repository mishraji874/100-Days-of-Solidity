/*
A multti-signature wallet is at type of digital wallet that requires multiple signatures to approve and execute transactions.
It basically adds an extra layer of security by disturbing control among multiple wallet owners. Here, each owner posses a unique private key, and a pre-defined number of owners must provide their approval before a transaction can be carried out.

Key Features and Benefits
1️⃣ Enhanced Security: By necessitating multiple signatures, multi-sig wallets significantly mitigate the risk of unauthorized transactions. Even if one private key is compromised, an attacker cannot access funds without obtaining the additional required signatures.

2️⃣ Shared Responsibility: The distributed nature of multi-sig wallets fosters a collective approach to security. Multiple owners must collaborate and approve transactions, preventing any single individual from having complete control over the funds.

3️⃣ Protection Against Human Error: Mistakes happen, but multi-sig wallets are designed to mitigate their impact. A transaction will only be executed if the specified number of owners approves it, safeguarding against accidental or unauthorized transfers.

/*
Explanation:

In this contract, several key components are defined:

- `owners`: An array that stores the addresses of all wallet owners.
- `approvals`: A mapping that keeps track of approvals for each transaction. It uses a nested mapping, where the outer mapping uses the transaction ID as the key and the inner mapping maps each owner’s address to a boolean value representing their approval status.
- `requiredApprovals`: A variable specifying the number of approvals needed for a transaction to be executed.
